## What is Zeon Bot?

Zeon Bot was my old Discord Bot, I'm declaring it open source now. It's a bot that has a lot of features, such as moderation, fun, and more. It's a bot that I've worked on for a while, and I'm proud of it. I'm not going to be working on it anymore, so I'm making it open source. I hope you enjoy it!

## Why it became Open Source/

This bot became open source because I'm not going to be working on it anymore. I don't want to get stuck in the past, and I want to move on to bigger and better things. I'm not going to be working on this bot anymore, so I'm making it open source. I hope you enjoy it!

In Short, I Want To Learn Game Development, Web Development, etc
